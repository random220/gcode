Certainly! To create a searchable PDF from scanned images while preserving the original look of the pages, you can use an open-source tool called **OCRmyPDF**. It's designed to add an OCR text layer beneath the scanned images, allowing the text to be searchable without altering the visual presentation of the pages.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Install OCRmyPDF**:
   - For Linux: Use the package manager, for example, `apt install ocrmypdf` for Debian/Ubuntu.
   - For Windows: You can use the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) and then install it with `apt install ocrmypdf`.
   - For macOS: Install using Homebrew with `brew install ocrmypdf`.

2. **Run OCRmyPDF**:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Use the following command to process your PDF file:
     ```bash
     ocrmypdf --input-language eng --rotate-pages --deskew --output-type pdfa input_scanned.pdf output_searchable.pdf
     ```
   - Replace `input_scanned.pdf` with the path to your scanned PDF file.
   - The `output_searchable.pdf` will be the new searchable PDF file.

3. **Options Explained**:
   - `--input-language eng`: Specifies the language for OCR; use `eng+fra` for English and French, for example.
   - `--rotate-pages`: Automatically corrects pages that are misrotated.
   - `--deskew`: Straightens pages that are crooked.
   - `--output-type pdfa`: Ensures the output is PDF/A, a format for long-term archiving.

OCRmyPDF uses the Tesseract OCR engine, which can recognize more than 100 languages, and it's capable of handling files with thousands of pagesÂ¹[1].

Remember to check the documentation of OCRmyPDF for more detailed instructions and additional options that you might find useful for your specific needs.

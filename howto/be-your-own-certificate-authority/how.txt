0. Create a Ubuntu 18.04 machine and log on there

1. Create key
   openssl genrsa -out server.CA.key 2048

   This generated server.CA.key
   This is encrypted with a password. Hint: Host!

2. Create a certificate signing request.
   openssl req -verbose -new -key server.CA.key -out server.CA.csr -sha256

   These were my answers
        Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
        State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
        Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Jose
        Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Om's Home
        Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:Kitchen
        Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Om Mandal
        Email Address []:om.mandal@gmail.com

        Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
        to be sent with your certificate request
        A challenge password []:
        An optional company name []:

   That created server.CA.csr

   (Save those two files under password protection. Retrieve them by running getkeys.sh)

3. Self-sign your certificate:
    openssl ca -extensions v3_ca \
    -keyfile server.CA.key \
    -infiles server.CA.csr \
    -out server.CA-signed.crt \
    -verbose \
    -selfsign \
    -md sha256 \
    -enddate 301231235959Z

    The end date of the certificate. The notation is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ where Z is
    in GMT, sometimes known as "Zulu" time.

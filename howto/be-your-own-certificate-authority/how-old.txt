ca is the minimal certification authority program.
"openssl ca ..." is the command

This is probably a more friendly certification authority application

0. Create a Ubuntu 18.04 machine and log on there

1. Create key
   openssl genrsa -out server.CA.key 2048

   This generated server.CA.key

2. Create a certificate signing request.
   openssl req -verbose -new -key server.CA.key -out server.CA.csr -sha256

       Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:US
       State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:California
       Locality Name (eg, city) []:San Jose
       Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Crondite Technologies
       Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:unit-0
       Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:Om Mandal
       Email Address []:om.mandal@gmail.com

       Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
       to be sent with your certificate request
       A challenge password []:
       An optional company name []:

   That created server.CA.csr

   (Save those two files under password protection. Retrieve them by running getkeys.sh)

3. Self-sign your certificate:

    touch ~/.rnd  # This file must exist, or error message below. The file
                  # content gets created by the below invocation

    openssl ca -extensions v3_ca \
    -keyfile server.CA.key \
    -infiles server.CA.csr \
    -out server.CA-signed.crt \
    -verbose \
    -selfsign \
    -md sha256 \
    -enddate 301531235959Z

    The end date of the certificate. The notation is YYMMDDHHMMSSZ where Z is
    in GMT, sometimes known as "Zulu" time.
